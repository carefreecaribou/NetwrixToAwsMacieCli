## Getting Started

This python file will take an exported Netwrix clueset in the .xml file and parse it to generate a bash script that will contain the generated AWS Macie2 Custom Dataset Identifiers. The bash script also allows you to supply extra identifiers in a shorthand format. Each script contains their own help files.
